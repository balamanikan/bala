        Kabaddi (/kəˈbædi/,[2] /ˈkʌbədi/)[3] is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players, originating in India.[4] The objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but return to the game after each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.
        
        It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the national sport of Bangladesh.[5] It is the second most popular and viewed sport in India after cricket.[4][6] It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh.[7]
        
        There are two major disciplines: "Punjabi kabaddi", also called "circle style", comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, and the "standard style", on a rectangular court indoors, is played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games.
        
        This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi or chedugudu in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabaddi, komonti or ha-du-du in West Bengal and Bangladesh; baibalaa in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India, ha-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in South India; kapardi in Nepal; kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu; and chakgudu in Sri Lanka. </p><br><br>

        <p>Etymology
            The raider is required to execute each raid on a single breath; in order to prove that they are not inhaling, they are required to repeatedly chant the word "kabaddi", in a process referred to as a cant.[9][10][a]
            
            Kabaddi is one of the many traditional Tamil sports that have been played by Tamil people since long ago. Before preparing for competitions (attacking and defending), Tamil people engage in training sessions, known as Kabaddi, for a considerable period. The term Kabaddi is a Tamil word composed of "Kai" and "Pidi".[11]

            Ancient era
            Origins of Kabaddi are not clear. The sport is said to have existed in the Indian subcontinent since prehistoric times.[4]
            
            Ronojoy Sen speculates in his book Nation At Play that kabaddi originated during the Vedic period (between 1500 BC and 500 BC).[4] There are accounts of Gautama Buddha and Lord Krishna having played an ancient form of the sport. <br><br>

            According to another version of the sport's origins, kabaddi originated in Maharashtra.[15] It was reportedly common among the ayrani maharashtrian people who lived in the Pune geographical region of ancient Maharashtra. 
            
            There are also accounts of kabaddi having been played in Iran 2,000 years ago.[18][19]
            
            Modern era
            Modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various forms under different names in the Indian subcontinent.[20] India has been first credited with having helped to popularise kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s,[21] their introduction to the programme of the Indian Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950,[21] and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi. These developments helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally been played on muddy surfaces in villages,[22][23] for legitimate international competition.[12][13][14]</p>
